Code for a discord bot to check messages sent by webhooks in a channel you choose, and if it is inactive it restarts mumuplayer (or any application you would like just add directory to whatever you want). Windows defender might auto delete the file since it flags it because it creates files and runs them. To solve this either turn off real time protection or allow it in Virus & threat protection/Protection History.
